Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game that is played around the world, with many different names and variations. It is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions, and in some cases is even played for sport. The rules require that competing players use one hand to form one of three shapes at an agreedupon time. The person that plays the strongest “object” is the winner of the game. It’s that easy! Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game that anybody can play and win.

You beat another player if your choice “beats” theirs in the following way:

<ul>

 <li>Rock beats Scissors</li>

 <li>Scissors beat Paper</li>

 <li>Paper beats Rock</li>

</ul>

Each round you score 1 for every other player you beat.

The first player to score 10 or more points wins the game. In case of a tie, the tying players play against each other until there is one winner.
